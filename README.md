# Graph
C# Graph:  <br />
  ListGraph.cs holds the code ListGraph which creates an adjacency list that represents a Graph. <br />
  Program.cs shows off the functionality of the class <br />
  
C# MarkovChain <br />
  Markov Chain extends the class ListGraph from Graph and applies Markov Chain applications on graphs as long as the graph fits the rules of a Markov Chain <br />
  
MIPS Assembly Graph Movement: <br />
  Through a Dynamic 2D array that represents an unweighted nondirected graph, the program will find the possible moves at a certain amount of turns through a Markov Chain system. <br />
  
MazeGeneration: <br />
  Using Disjoint sets and union by size, the program creates a randomly generated maze.<br />
Dijkstra: <br />
  Uses an adjacency list to find the shortest route in a graph from A to B <br />
